# Discord LLM Bot

This is a Discord bot that integrates with a language model (LLM) to create a conversational AI experience. The bot remembers the last 50 messages exchanged with users and provides responses accordingly. Built using **Discord.js** and **LangChain**, it can integrate with various AI models.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Integration with a powerful LLM (like Groq API).
